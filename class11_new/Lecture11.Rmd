## Section 1
**Q1.** What proportion of PDB entries does X-ray crystallography account for? What proportion of
structures are protein?
**A1.** Yearly: 3135; Total: 125271

```{r}
pdb.stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

Let's calculate something!

```{r}
percent <- (pdb.stats$Total / sum (pdb.stats$Total)*100)
names(percent) <- pdb.stats$Experimental.Method
percent 
```
